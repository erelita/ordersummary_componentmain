## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got a little frustrated about centering the <main> and later realized that I have forgotten to add the height on the body to center align it vertically using grid.

```html
<main> </main>
```
```css
body {
  display: grid;
  height: 100vh;
  justify-content: center;
  align-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to get familiar with grid in the future. And also javascript.
